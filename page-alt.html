                    <p class="nero">***Auditory dyslexia*** 
                        This refers to the difficulty in processing the sounds of phonemes and being unable to connect them to their written form. A phoneme is a distinct unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another for example P, B, D and T in the English language. 
                        This may mean that someone with auditory dyslexia often misunderstands verbal instruction, can’t hear if there is background noise and may struggle to pronounce L, R or Ths. They may also scramble multi-syllable words and have difficulty following instructions. 
                        
                        ***Visual*** 
                        The visual type may mean that text appears blurry or goes in and out of focus. Text may appear double or alternate between single and double. Someone with this type of dyslexia may struggle with keeping their place in the text. They may also experience headaches or eye strain associated with reading. 
                        
                        ***Double-deficit dyslexia*** 
                        Difficulty with auditory processes and naming speeds. It is also known as comorbid dyslexia where someone has two different types of reading difficulties. This might be authority and surface dyslexia where someone
                        may not find phonetics difficult but may struggle with words that appear different to how they are pronounced such as yacht or island. 
                        
                        ***Rapid Naming Deficit*** 
                        People with this form cannot name colours, numbers or letters quickly. It can impact a person’s reading skills or cause a person to say the wrong word or create a placeholder if they can’t think of the missed word. 
                        
                        Are dyslexia dysgraphia and dyscalculia the same thing? 
                        No - each one is an individual condition, but a person can have more than one. Dyslexia and dysgraphia are easy to confuse because they share symptoms and often occur together. All three conditions are not linked to autism, but a person may also have the condition separately. 
                        
                        ***Dysgraphia*** 
                        Dysgraphia involves difficulty with the act of writing. This can range from difficulties with physically writing words and also with organizing and writing down thoughts. 
                        
                        ***Dyscalculia*** 
                        A difficulty in understanding numbers that can cause problems with understanding mathematics. A person may struggle with counting and use their fingers, be unable to recognise and use + or - signs and not be able to remember mathematical facts such as 2 + 2 = 4.</p>
